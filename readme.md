## detail
h3r means H3 rotated

[H3](https://github.com/uber/h3) is a hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system from uber.

However its base layer and derived layers are fixed.

A rotation method for H3 is promoted so that the base layer's face centroids can be specified.

## visualization
If you want to use [amap](https://ditu.amap.com/) to visualize the hexagon layer with python,
package [amapjson](https://github.com/wlbksy/amapjson) is recommended.
